# PartyJeopardy

PartyJeopardy is a hacky Jeopardy! game for smaller parties.
While making this, I focused on functionality and not on code quality and style. Hack at your own risk.

### Dependencies

* Twitter Bootstrap (is included, MIT licence)
* A JSON-Object containing questions and answers (example in the German language is included)
* A local Web-Server (to install, clone the repo to its directory)

**Warning:** This does not come with any protection whatsoever. **DO NOT** upload this to a public web server!
Luckily, PHP has a built-in web server! Run `php -S localhost:9000` in your CLI and navigate your browser to the same address.

### Information

This project is in no way affiliated with Jeopardy!, its producers or distributors. 
It is a stand-alone project based on the idea of the Jeopady! game show created solely for entertainment purposes. 

### Licence

This code (except otherwise noted in the files) is published and released to the Public Domain, so anyone can benefit from my work without any restrictions.
